    "The [Med3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00625) study reports that medical volumes often exhibit heterogeneous voxel spacing due to differences in scanners and acquisition protocols. To mitigate this variability, the median spacing for each axis (x, y, z) is calculated within each domain, where a domain is defined by specific equipment and acquisition protocols. This approach ensures that the estimated spacing remains robust against outliers and minor data errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, a domain is defined by imaging modality (which can be \"CTA\", \"MRA\", \"MRI T1post\", \"MRI T2\"), resulting in four distinct domains. For each domain, the median spacing of each series is calculated. The method for determining spacing in each series depends on the type of DICOM file present:\n",
    "- For series containing a single DICOM file representing the entire volume (3D), spacing is obtained from the attribute specifying the spacing for the whole volume.\n",
    "- For series containing a collection of DICOM files from slices (2D), spacing is determined as the mode of all spacings. It is assumed that most spacings within each series are consistent. Instances with differing spacings are considered data errors and are excluded from the final median computation for each domain, by using only the mode of all spacings.\n",
