# RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Competition

This is a series of posts describing what I did in the [RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-intracranial-aneurysm-detection) Kaggle competition. The resulting code is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/afonsomm98/index-rsna-iad) and on [my blog](https://afonso.matosomagalhaes.com/posts/rsna_iad).

Run `source develop` on a terminal that can execute bash scripts.
